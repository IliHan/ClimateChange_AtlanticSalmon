# ClimateChange_AtlanticSalmon
Data in Brief associated materials

Discharge and water temperature simulations were produced using CEQUEAU, a deterministic semi-distributed hydrological and thermal model. CEQUEAU was applied to 35 Atlantic salmon rivers across northeastern Canada and the United States to simulate daily mean discharge and water temperature time series under both historical (1979–2020) and future (2030–2100) climate conditions. For the future periods two scenarios within the CMIP6 model are considered, including the SSP3-7.0 and the SSP5-8.5.
- Time series are available in each rivers name folder in csv format.
- Figures 2, 3, S4 and S5 are produced using the code Figures_2_3_S4_S5 and uses the globo_rhw_'rivername'_ssp370(585) for Water temperature and globo_rhw_Q_'rivername'_ssp370(585) for discharge found in river's name folder for each climate change scenario.
- Figure4_S6.r produce Figure 4 and S6 which represent boxplots of discharge and percent change across historical and future projections.
- Historical and projected Riverine heatwave statistics are provided within the M_'ClimateChangeModel'_MeanIntensityCum files. These files are produced using Figure5_DataGen. Rivers are Numbered from 1 to 35 (order found in Figure5_.r code).

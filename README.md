# ClimateChange_AtlanticSalmon
Data in Brief associated materials
Discharge and water temperature simulations were produced using CEQUEAU, a deterministic semi-distributed hydrological and thermal model. CEQUEAU was applied to 35 Atlantic salmon rivers across northeastern Canada and the United States to simulate daily mean discharge and water temperature time series under both historical (1979–2020) and future (2030–2100) climate conditions. For the future periods two scenarios within the CMIP6 model are considered, including the SSP3-7.0 and the SSP5-8.5.
- Time series are available in each rivers name folder in csv format.
- Historical and projected Riverine heatwave statistics are provided within the M_'ClimateChangeModel'_MeanIntensityCum files. Rivers are Numbered from 1 to 35 (order found in Figure5_.r code.
